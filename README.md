# ld33

Made for Ludum Dare #33 (Jam category). 
This is the unfinished version of the game made in the 72h time limit of the game jam. There are still a lot of bugs (graphics and code) and so it is currently impossible to finish it.
A post-jam version will be made available on a different branch.

/!\ THIS REQUIRES PYTHON 2.7 & PYGAME 1.9 TO RUN /!\
